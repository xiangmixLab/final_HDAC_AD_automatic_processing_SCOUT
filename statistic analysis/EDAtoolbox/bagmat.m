% BAGMAT.EXE Generates bagplot files
%
%   You must run bagmat.exe in the current directory. 
%   To run from the command line, use:
%
%       ! bagmat
%
%   and hit RETURN. You will see a blank line at the
%   command window, but no text. Type the name of the data
%   file and hit return. The data file must be ascii and
%   contain one observation per line. Next type in the
%   number of observations and hit return. 
%
%   Several files have been created and saved in the
%   current directory: interpol.dat, datatyp.dat, and
%   tukmed.dat. These are used in the bagplot.m file.
