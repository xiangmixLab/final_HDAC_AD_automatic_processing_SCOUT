1. Combine neuron extractions using from the same batch together using combine_neurons_after_extraction and combine_neurons_after_extraction_full. 

2. Combine each extraction for the full experiment, using Combine_Full_Experiment






Interpretation


Quality Measures

overlap_corr: correlations between neurons on the overlap between batches
overlap_dist: distance between neurons between batches
scores: aggregate score of neuron quality on a single batch
combined: number of times a neuron appears in each batch, between all of the extractions performed on that batch.

overlap_corr and combined should be high. Expect the mean combined score to be between 2 and 3 for a good quality neuron, and overlap_corr should be above .6, and preferably higher.

overlap_dist should be low, preferably less than 6. It represents the number of pixels neurons move between batches

scores should be low. It is a linear combination of KL_score and correlation. This is difficult to interpret. The best option is to plot a histogram of scores, and remove neurons that have outlying large scores.



Outputs

C - calcium fluorescence for individual neurons
S - extracted spike times for individual neurons (This is not terribly accurate from what we've seen)
C_raw - raw calcium fluorescence.
centroid - spatial location of neuron centroid
A - neuron spatial footprint.
