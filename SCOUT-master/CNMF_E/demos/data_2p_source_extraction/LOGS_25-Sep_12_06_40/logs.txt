[12:06:44]Start running source extraction......
The collection of options are saved as intermediate_results.options_0

[12:06:44]Start initializing neurons from frame 1 to frame 2000

[12:06:47]Finished the initialization procedure.
	In total, 48 neurons were initialized. 
	The initialization results were saved as intermediate_results.initialization

[12:06:48]Finished updating background using svd model.
	The results were saved as intermediate_results.bg_25_Sep_12_06_48

[12:06:48]Start picking neurons from the residual......
	The collection of options are saved as intermediate_results.options_2
[12:06:49]Finished the initialization of neurons from the residual video.
	In total, 4 neurons were detected. 
	The  results were saved as intermediate_results.initialization_res_25_Sep_12_06_49

[12:06:50]Finished updating temporal components.
	The results were saved as intermediate_results.temporal_25_Sep_12_06_50

[12:06:51]Finished updating spatial components.
	The results were saved as intermediate_results.spatial_25_Sep_12_06_50

[12:06:51]Start Merging neurons based on temporal correlations and neuron distances:
 	Thresholds:
		Temporal correlation of C: 0.700
		Minimum distance: 10.000
	13 neurons will be merged into 5 new neurons.
[12:06:51]You approved all merges.
		1, 17, 49, ---> 1
		4, 19, ---> 4
		12, 15, 25, ---> 12
		23, 37, ---> 23
		26, 47, 48, ---> 26
	The spatial and temporal components of the merged neurons were saved as intermediate_results.spatial_25_Sep_12_06_51
	Now the old neurons will be deleted and the merged new ones will replace them.

[12:06:51]Deleted 8 neurons: 
15, 17, 19, 25, 37, 47, 48, 49, 
	The IDS of these neurons were saved as intermediate_results.spatial_25_Sep_12_06_51

[12:06:51]Start Merging neurons based on neuron distances:
 	Options:
		Minimum distance: 2.000
		Method for computing neuron center: max
	2 neurons will be merged into 1 new neurons.
